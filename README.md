# 🚀 Real-World Software Pipeline Simulation using Python Abstraction
This project simulates a real-world software development pipeline, showcasing how software, data engineering, and ML teams collaborate through structured, versioned, and abstracted codebases.

The primary goal is to demonstrate:

✅ How code is structured and divided across teams

✅ How abstraction ensures clean integration and extensibility

✅ How GitHub workflows can mimic real-world CI/CD pipeline

| Role                   | Responsibility                               | File               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 👨‍💼 Senior Developer | Designs abstract skeleton using base classes | `Version1.py`      |
| 👨‍💻 Junior Developer | Inherits and implements core logic           | `Version2.py`      |
| 🧪 User/Tester         | Executes complete pipeline via CLI           | `main_version2.py` |

🔁 Versioned Development Flow

| Version | Role       | Description                                       |
| ------: | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
|  **V1** | Senior Dev | Abstract base class structure (`Version1.py`)     |
|  **V2** | Junior Dev | Implements logic over V1 skeleton (`Version2.py`) |
|  **V3** | Senior Dev | Adds new abstract methods for extended features   |
|  **V4** | Junior Dev | Implements V3 methods to support new features     |

# 🧰 Technologies & Concepts Used

🔹 Python OOP with Abstract Base Classes (abc)

🔹 Modular, readable, and scalable code structure

🔹 User-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) via argparse

🔹 Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

🔹 Object Detection using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

✨ Designed to be intuitive: the user can run the full pipeline without needing to read the internals.
